SNOW is table Triggered JavaScript

Scripting Overview

1. What is platform Scripting?
Platform Scripting allows complex configuartion and behaviours via JS

However, when making changes to your instance use the Condition Builder wherever possible to 
configure starightforward conditions and actions

SNOW whenever goes to read a table it reads the other supporting tables like UI policies and other tables and when
it encounters these tables and the JS script written in it, then it runs the JS scripts

2. Why to not script in SNOW?
    a. SNOW is continually evolving and the earlier scripts may not be necessary
    b. Easier to debug and fix configuration changes thatn customization
    c. Make sure the script is really needed
        1. How business critical is this script
        2. Will an ACL perform what is needed instead?
        3. Can you acheive at least 805 of requirements via configuration changes instead of scripting
    d. consider ways of customizing without scripting

3. When should you script?
    a. Add new functionality
    b. Extend existing functionality
    c. Guide users through messaging
    d. Automate processes
    e. Interact with third party applications

4. Customization best practices

SNOW is always trying to make the upgrade process easier. Adopting this process help wiht future upgrades to your instance 

If a No code/Low code approach cannot be determined then Modify the baseline records and Review and revert the skipped record adter an Upgrade

5. Where do scripts execute?
    a. Client Side (Browser):
        -   Auto-populate a field based on value of another field 
        -   show hidden form sections

    #   Client Scripts
        UI Policies
        Catalog Scripting

    b. Server Side
        -   Modify a database record
        -   Trigger a flow

    #   Business Rules
        GlideSystem
        GlideRecord
        Script Includes
        Flow Designer
    
    c. On a Mid Server
        -   Integrate to a third party application

6. Who can Script?
    a. System Admininstrator
        Manages all the features, applications and data in the platform 
    b. System Definition Admininstrator
        Manage a specific systme Definition 
        Ex: Can only manage Business Rules
    c. Application Admininstrator

7. How to script in SNOW?
    Using Script editor available in the SNP 

8. Syntax editor Macros
    These provides shourtcuts for commonly used code
    Insert a macro by typing the macro Name and pressing <TAB>
    Macro name is replaced with full macro text

RESULT: of help <TAB>

The Syntax Editor macros are:
-----------------------------
testNewFunctions - Use this Macro to test the functions from the ValidatorNew script include
doc - Documentation Header 
for - Standard loop for arrays
vargror - Example GlideRecord Or Query
info - 
method - Standard JavaScript Class Method
vargr - A common pattern of creating and querying a GlideRecord

####

Locating your script Quickly

Navigate directly to Table configuartion

Ex: incident.config will display all the configuartion changes made to that table

### Application Scopes

Every Application has a scope
Determines which resources are availableto other application
Once the scope is assigned to an application, it cannot be changed!!!

Application Scopes protects an application and its artifcacts from damage to, or from other applications
Must be configured to grant other applicationthe ablity to act on its record

# Application Scope: Scope Namespace Identifier

The system automatically prefixes a namespace identifier to scoped application artifcats (including scripts)
Canneot be changed or removed to ensure they are always associated with the proper application

    Scoped application artifcacts always begins wiht x_
    Then the vendor prefix, SNC 
    Then the application ID - Set when the application is first created
    Script Name - unique script name

    This example generates the namespace identifier: x_cld_travel_ExpensesReqBy


# Application Scope: Updating Scripts in Another Scope

Out of scope scripts are read-only

Client Script Overview: What is a Client Script?
Client Script manage the behaviour of forms, fields and lists in real time.
    -   Make fields Mandatory
    -   Set one field in response to another
    -   Modify choice list options
    -   Hide/show form sections
    -   Hide/fields
    -   Display an alert
    -   Manage/prohibit list ending

Client script executes on client side - Browser may present the info in a different way

Client scripts are not secured, since the info is already loaded in the browser, therefore it should not be used for 
critical access controlling. Use ACLs for those

#Client Scripts are a record in the Client script table
Client scripts table will only run when the conditions are triggered

Diffrent types on Client Scripts
1. onLoad() - will run when the form is loaded and the control is given to the user
2. onChange()
3. 
4. onSubmit()
